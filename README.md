# multifuck

What the *fuck* is this? Well, it's a Brainfuck interpreter written in Clojure.

## Why the *fuck* would you do this?

Why the *fuck* not?

## What can I do?

If you run `lein run` it will run "Hello World" in Brainfuck.

## What can't it do?

Read input. The JVM is weird, so that has to be figured out without requiring
the enter/return key from getting pressed before input is available.
